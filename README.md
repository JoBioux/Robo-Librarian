# Robo-Librarian
A program based on ChongChong He's "booklet-creator", to expand the size of the book one could wish to print


Give me a 4+ pages PDF document, and I'll edit it to enable you to print it, split it into piles 
of x sheets (x being 8 by default, but you can set the number you like using '-n [int]'), fold 
each of the booklet and make them stay together (sewing them for example) and finally combining
all of your booklet into your very own edition of your favorite text !
                                                                      
          Printer settings :
                 Paper size: Tabloid (11*17 in) for academic papers, books, etc 
                 Layout: 2 pages per sheet. Set layout direction to normal 'Z' layout. Set two-sided to Short-Edge binding 
                 Scale to fit the page. An example setup for ARA&A:
                                        162% on 11*17 Borderless
